# FastestCart
Problem Statement

Implement the following function: def FastestCart, d1, d2, d3):

The function accepts four positive integers 't', 'd1', 'd2' and 'd3' as its argument. 3 cars cover distances 'd', 'd2' and 'd3" in time 't'. Implement the function to find the fastest car by calculating their speed and return the speed of the fastest car.


Speed = Distance / Time

Note: Consider division operation as integral operation.

Example:

Input: 

t: 25

d1: 125

d2: 225

d3: 625

Output

25

Explanation:

Speed of cars are:

﻿﻿Speed of 1st car = 125 / 25 - 5h
  
﻿﻿Speed of 20d car = 225 / 25 = 9
  
﻿﻿Speed of 3rd car = 625 / 25 - 25
  
Speed of the fastest car is 25. Thus, output is 25.

Sample input

t: 4

d1: 248

d2: 124

d3: 200

Sample Output

62

Instructions :

﻿﻿This is a template based question, DO NOT write the "main" function.
﻿﻿Your code is judged by an automated system, do not write any additional welcome/greeting messages.
﻿﻿"Save and Test" only checks for basic test cases, more rigorous cases will be used to judge your code while scoring.
﻿﻿Additional score will be given for writing optimized code both in terms of memory and execution time. Python
